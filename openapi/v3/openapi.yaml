        Note that the server doesn't make any guarantee about the delivery or order of these events. In particular events
        that happen while the client is disconnected will not be delivered. Clients should consider using other mechanisms
        to ensure that they process objects correctly. For example, they can combine this watch mechanism with periodic
        redconciliation of all the objects.

          The value of this parameter is a [CEL](https://cel.dev) boolean expression. The `event` variable will contain the
          fields of the event. If the result of the expression is `true` then the event will be sent by the server. For
          example, to receive only the events that indicate that a cluster order has been modified and is now in the
          fulfilled state:

          ```
          event.type == EVENT_TYPE_OBJECT_CREATED && event.cluster_order.status.state == CLUSTER_ORDER_STATE_FULFILLED
          ```

          If this isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then all the events that the user has permission to see will be
          sent by the server.

        Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for
        payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or
        an HTML page.


        This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in
        the request as well as the response.

        It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one
        wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.

        Example:

            message GetResourceRequest {
              // A unique request id.
              string request_id = 1;

              // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
              google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;

            }

            service ResourceService {
              rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest)
                returns (google.api.HttpBody);
              rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

            }

        Example with streaming methods:

            service CaldavService {
              rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
              rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);

            }

        Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are
        handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.
    protobufAny:
      type: object
      properties:
        '@type':
          type: string
          description: |-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
            type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely used type server
            implementations and no plans to implement one.

            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
            used with implementation specific semantics.

        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }

        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }
            // or ...
            if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
            }

         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...

         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
             if err != nil {
               ...
             }
             ...
             foo := &pb.Foo{}
             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
               ...
             }

        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
        name "y.z".

        JSON
        ====
        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

            package google.profile;
            message Person {
              string first_name = 1;
              string last_name = 2;
            }

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
              "firstName": <string>,
              "lastName": <string>
            }

        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
              "value": "1.212s"
            }

            $ref: "#/components/schemas/v1ClusterNodeSet"
          description: |-
            Desired node sets of the cluster.

            This will be automatically set by the system when the cluster is initially created, according to the template
            selected by the user, and can be later modified to change the size.

            The key of the map is the unique identifier of the node set for this cluster.

            For example, a cluster created with two different node sets, one for nodes without GPUs and another for nodes with
            GPUs could be represented like this:

            ```json
            {
              "id": "123",
              "spec": {
                "node_sets": {
                  "compute": {
                    "host_class": "acme_1tb",
                    "size": 3
                  },
                  "gpu": {
                    "host_class": "acme_1tb_h100",
                    "size": 3
                  }
                }
              },
              "status": {
                "state": "CLUSTER_STATE_READY",
                "node_sets": {
                  "compute": {
                    "host_class": "acme_1tb",
                    "size": 3
                  },
                  "gpu": {
                    "host_class": "acme_1tb_h100",
                    "size": 3
                  }
                }
              }
            }
            ```

            The user will not be allowed to change the `host_class` field.

            The user will be allowed to add new node sets.

            The user will be allowed to remove existing node sets, except when only one node set remains. Clusters
            must have at least one node set.

            The user will be allowed to update `size` field.

            If at any time the system can't allocate the number of nodes requested by the user, because of permissions, quota,
            availability of resources or system errors, the cluster will be marked as degraded, and the details will be in the
            `DEGRADED` condition.

          description: |-
            Contains a list of conditions that describe in detail the status of the cluster.

            For example, an cluster that is ready could be represented like this (when converted to JSON):

               {
                 "id": "123",
                 "spec": {
                 },
                 "status": {
                   "state": "CLUSTER_STATE_READY",
                   "conditions": [
                     {
                       "type": "CLUSTER_CONDITION_TYPE_READY",
                       "status": "CONDITION_STATUS_TRUE",
                       "last_transition_time": "2025-03-12 20:15:59+00:00",
                       "message": "The cluster is ready to use",
                     },
                     {
                       "type": "CLUSTER_CONDITION_TYPE_FAILED",
                       "status": "CONDITION_STATUS_FALSE",
                       "last_transition_time": "2025-03-12 20:10:59+00:00"
                     }
                   ]
                 }
               }

            In this example the `READY` condition is true. That tells us that the cluster is ready to use via the API URL
            provided in the `status.api_url` field.

            The `FAILED` condition is false. That tells us that the cluster is *not* failed.

            Note that in this example, to make it shorter, only one condition appears. In general all the conditions (except
            `UNSPECIFIED`) will appear exactly once.

            When using the HTTP+JSON version of the API the values must be represented as documented in the (ProtoJSON format

            ```json

            RestartRequestedAt is a timestamp signal to request a ComputeInstance restart.

            Set this field to the current time (usually NOW) to request a restart.
            The controller will execute the restart if this timestamp is greater than
            `status.last_restarted_at`.

            This is a declarative signal mechanism - the timestamp is a monotonically
            increasing value to detect new restart requests, not a scheduled time.
            Typically set to the current time for immediate restarts.

            External schedulers can set this field on a schedule to implement
            scheduled maintenance windows if needed.

            Example (when converted to JSON):

               {
                 "spec": {
                   "template": "123",

            Contains a list of conditions that describe in detail the status of the compute instance.

            For example, a running compute instance could be represented like this (when converted to JSON):

               {
                 "id": "123",
                 "spec": {
                 },
                 "status": {
                   "state": "COMPUTE_INSTANCE_STATE_RUNNING",
                   "conditions": [
                     {
                       "type": "COMPUTE_INSTANCE_CONDITION_TYPE_AVAILABLE",
                       "status": "CONDITION_STATUS_TRUE",

                   ]
                 }
               }

            In this example the `AVAILABLE` condition is true. That tells us that the compute instance is available via the IP address
            provided in the `status.ip_address` field.

            Note that in this example, to make it shorter, only one condition appears. In general all the conditions (except
            `UNSPECIFIED`) will appear exactly once.

            Check the documentation of the values of the `ComputeInstanceConditionType` enumerated type to see possible conditions and
            reasons.

            ```http

            Contains a list of conditions that describe in detail the status of the host pool.

            For example, a host pool that is ready could be represented like this (when converted to JSON):

               {
                 "id": "123",
                 "spec": {
                 },
                 "status": {
                   "state": "HOST_POOL_STATE_READY",
                   "conditions": [
                     {
                       "type": "HOST_POOL_CONDITION_TYPE_READY",
                       "status": "CONDITION_STATUS_TRUE",
                       "last_transition_time": "2025-03-12 20:15:59+00:00",
                       "message": "The host pool is ready to use",
                     },
                     {
                       "type": "HOST_POOL_CONDITION_TYPE_FAILED",
                       "status": "CONDITION_STATUS_FALSE",
                       "last_transition_time": "2025-03-12 20:10:59+00:00"
                     }
                   ]
                 }
               }

            In this example the `READY` condition is true. That tells us that the host pool is ready to use via the API URL
            provided in the `status.api_url` field.

            The `FAILED` condition is false. That tells us that the host pool is *not* failed.

            Note that in this example, to make it shorter, only one condition appears. In general all the conditions (except
            `UNSPECIFIED`) will appear exactly once.

        Describes a network implementation strategy available for creating virtual networks.

        NetworkClass represents a specific network backend implementation that VirtualNetworks can use. For example,
        there could be a network class `udn-net` to describe networks implemented using User-Defined Networks in
        Kubernetes, and another `phys-net` for networks backed by physical network infrastructure.

        This is similar to the _storage class_ concept used by Kubernetes for persistent volumes, or the _instance type_
        concept used by cloud providers for compute resources.

        Users query available NetworkClasses to discover which network implementation strategies they can choose when
        creating VirtualNetworks. The `implementation_strategy` field is the key identifier that VirtualNetwork resources
        reference to select their network backend.

        Represents a virtual firewall controlling network traffic for compute instances.

        SecurityGroup acts as a stateful firewall that controls inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) traffic for
        compute instances within a VirtualNetwork. Rules are stateful, meaning return traffic is automatically allowed
        for established connections.

        SecurityGroups follow a default-deny policy: if no rules match, traffic is blocked. This ensures secure-by-default
        behavior where only explicitly allowed traffic can pass through.

        SecurityGroups are scoped to a VirtualNetwork and can be attached to multiple compute instances within that
        network. They cannot be used across different VirtualNetworks.

        The parent VirtualNetwork relationship is established via metadata.annotations using the 'osac.io/owner-reference'
        key with the VirtualNetwork ID as the value. This enables proper resource hierarchy for garbage collection - when
        a VirtualNetwork is deleted, all associated SecurityGroups are automatically cleaned up.

        Design follows AWS Security Groups and Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) patterns, adapted for cloud-native
        multi-tenant environments.

        The spec contains user-specified firewall rules that define allowed network traffic. Rules are evaluated

        Lifecycle states for SecurityGroup resources.

        State transitions typically follow: UNSPECIFIED -> PENDING -> READY, with FAILED as a terminal error state
        that may require user intervention or resource recreation.

         - SECURITY_GROUP_STATE_UNSPECIFIED: State is unknown or has not been determined yet. This is the default state before initialization.
         - SECURITY_GROUP_STATE_PENDING: The security group is being initialized and is not ready for use yet.

        During this state, the system is:
        - Validating firewall rules (port ranges, CIDR notation)
        - Checking parent VirtualNetwork exists and is in READY state
        - Configuring firewall backend
        - Installing rules in the network infrastructure

        Security groups in PENDING state cannot be attached to compute instances.
         - SECURITY_GROUP_STATE_READY: The security group is fully operational and ready for compute instances to use.

        In this state:
        - All rules are validated and active
        - Firewall backend is configured
        - Security group can be attached to compute instances
        - Traffic filtering is enforced according to the rules
         - SECURITY_GROUP_STATE_FAILED: The security group has encountered an error and is unusable.

        Common failure reasons include:
        - Invalid port range (port_from > port_to, or values outside 1-65535)
        - Invalid CIDR notation
        - Parent VirtualNetwork does not exist
        - Parent VirtualNetwork is not in READY state
        - Protocol tcp/udp missing required port fields
        - Firewall backend configuration error

        The status.message field will contain specific error details. Failed security groups typically require
        deletion and recreation with corrected parameters, or resolution of the parent VirtualNetwork issue.

        The spec contains user-specified parameters that define how the subnet should be configured. These fields
        follow a declarative model where users specify the desired state and the system reconciles to match it.
    v1SubnetState:

        Lifecycle states for Subnet resources.

        State transitions typically follow: UNSPECIFIED -> PENDING -> READY, with FAILED as a terminal error state
        that may require user intervention or resource recreation.

         - SUBNET_STATE_UNSPECIFIED: State is unknown or has not been determined yet. This is the default state before initialization.
         - SUBNET_STATE_PENDING: The subnet is being initialized and is not ready for use yet.

        During this state, the system is:
        - Validating that the parent VirtualNetwork exists and is in READY state
        - Validating CIDR blocks (format, subset of parent, no overlaps)
        - Allocating IP address space within the parent VirtualNetwork
        - Configuring subnet routing and network policies

        Compute instances cannot be attached to subnets in PENDING state.
         - SUBNET_STATE_READY: The subnet is fully operational and ready for compute instances to attach.

        In this state:
        - CIDR blocks are allocated and validated
        - Parent VirtualNetwork is in READY state
        - Subnet routing is configured
        - Compute instances can be created and attached
        - IP address allocation is active
         - SUBNET_STATE_FAILED: The subnet has encountered an error and is unusable.

        Common failure reasons include:
        - Invalid CIDR notation
        - CIDR block is not a subset of parent VirtualNetwork CIDR
        - CIDR block overlaps with existing subnets in the same VirtualNetwork
        - Parent VirtualNetwork not found
        - Parent VirtualNetwork not in READY state
        - Network configuration error

        The status.message field will contain specific error details. Failed subnets typically require deletion
        and recreation with corrected parameters.

        VirtualNetwork provides network isolation for compute instances within a region. Each VirtualNetwork is backed
        by a specific NetworkClass implementation strategy (e.g., "udn-net" for User-Defined Networks, "phys-net" for
        physical network infrastructure).

        VirtualNetworks support flexible IP addressing:
        - IPv4-only: Set ipv4_cidr, leave ipv6_cidr empty
        - IPv6-only: Set ipv6_cidr, leave ipv4_cidr empty
        - Dual-stack: Set both ipv4_cidr and ipv6_cidr

        The selected NetworkClass must support the requested IP addressing mode via its capabilities.

        Tenant isolation is enforced via the standard shared.v1.Metadata tenants field. VirtualNetworks are scoped to
        a single region and cannot span multiple regions.

            Implementation strategy identifier for this network class. This is the discriminator that VirtualNetwork
            resources use to select which network backend to use. For example: "udn-net", "phys-net", "ovn-kubernetes".

            This value is system-defined and immutable once the NetworkClass is created.

        Describes a network implementation strategy available for creating virtual networks.

        NetworkClass represents a specific network backend implementation that VirtualNetworks can use. For example,
        there could be a network class `udn-net` to describe networks implemented using User-Defined Networks in
        Kubernetes, and another `phys-net` for networks backed by physical network infrastructure.

        This is similar to the _storage class_ concept used by Kubernetes for persistent volumes, or the _instance type_
        concept used by cloud providers for compute resources.

        Users query available NetworkClasses to discover which network implementation strategies they can choose when
        creating VirtualNetworks. The `implementation_strategy` field is the key identifier that VirtualNetwork resources
        reference to select their network backend.

        Represents a virtual firewall controlling network traffic for compute instances.

        SecurityGroup acts as a stateful firewall that controls inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) traffic for
        compute instances within a VirtualNetwork. Rules are stateful, meaning return traffic is automatically allowed
        for established connections.

        SecurityGroups follow a default-deny policy: if no rules match, traffic is blocked. This ensures secure-by-default
        behavior where only explicitly allowed traffic can pass through.

        SecurityGroups are scoped to a VirtualNetwork and can be attached to multiple compute instances within that
        network. They cannot be used across different VirtualNetworks.

        The parent VirtualNetwork relationship is established via metadata.annotations using the 'osac.io/owner-reference'
        key with the VirtualNetwork ID as the value. This enables proper resource hierarchy for garbage collection - when
        a VirtualNetwork is deleted, all associated SecurityGroups are automatically cleaned up.

        Design follows AWS Security Groups and Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) patterns, adapted for cloud-native
        multi-tenant environments.

        Represents a subdivision of a VirtualNetwork for organizing compute instances.

        Subnets subdivide VirtualNetwork IP address space into smaller, manageable segments. Each Subnet belongs to exactly
        one parent VirtualNetwork and must be in the same region. Initially, the system supports a 1:1 mapping between
        VirtualNetwork and Subnet (one subnet per network), but the schema is designed to support multiple subnets per
        VirtualNetwork in the future.

        Subnets support flexible IP addressing to match the parent VirtualNetwork's capabilities:
        - IPv4-only: Set ipv4_cidr, leave ipv6_cidr empty
        - IPv6-only: Set ipv6_cidr, leave ipv4_cidr empty
        - Dual-stack: Set both ipv4_cidr and ipv6_cidr

        The parent VirtualNetwork relationship should be specified via metadata.annotations using the 'osac.io/owner-reference'
        key with the VirtualNetwork ID as the value. This establishes resource hierarchy for garbage collection, ensuring
        that Subnets are automatically cleaned up when their parent VirtualNetwork is deleted.

        CIDR blocks must be non-overlapping within the same VirtualNetwork. Each Subnet's CIDR must be a subset of the
        parent VirtualNetwork's CIDR. Validation is enforced at the service layer.

        Represents a tenant-isolated virtual network.

        VirtualNetwork provides network isolation for compute instances within a region. Each VirtualNetwork is backed
        by a specific NetworkClass implementation strategy (e.g., "udn-net" for User-Defined Networks, "phys-net" for
        physical network infrastructure).

        VirtualNetworks support flexible IP addressing:
        - IPv4-only: Set ipv4_cidr, leave ipv6_cidr empty
        - IPv6-only: Set ipv6_cidr, leave ipv4_cidr empty
        - Dual-stack: Set both ipv4_cidr and ipv6_cidr

        The selected NetworkClass must support the requested IP addressing mode via its capabilities.

        Tenant isolation is enforced via the standard shared.v1.Metadata tenants field. VirtualNetworks are scoped to
        a single region and cannot span multiple regions.
